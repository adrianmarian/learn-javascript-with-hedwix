# Time to Say Hello, World!

It's time to run JavaScript code using Node.

First, create a new JavaScript file named `chapter-01.js` from the command prompt:

```shell
touch chapter-01.js
```

Next, add this line of code into the file:

```js
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

Now let's run the script with Node by running this command:

```shell
node chapter-01.js
```

The console will reply with printing "Hello, World!" into the console.

You've just ran your very first JavaScript code using Node.js. Congratulations!

Granted, this is not the most useful program in the world, but this small piece of code proves that you can run JavaScript perfectly.
