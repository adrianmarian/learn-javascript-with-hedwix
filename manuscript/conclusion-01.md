# Parting words

You have reached the end of this book and have learned all you need to know about JavaScript to build web applications. JavaScript is not just a simple scripting language. It is fully able to do complex processing with looping and conditional statements. It supports object oriented programming with the use of object and class. And it also allows for functional programming with function callback.

JavaScript can also interact with browser and Node.js, in which it can access certain APIs and modules to further develop sophisticated application to help people with their daily lives. It allows the creation of web applications with dynamic content.

Congratulations on finishing this book! Few people can keep their commitment to learning from start to finish.

There are more JavaScript knowledge that I'd like to write and share with you through this book. If you'd like to be informed when I write a new learning resource, you can follow my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nsebhastian) or join my [newsletter](https://sebhastian.com/subscribe/). I promise I will only send news related to programming!

## What to do next

With all the things you have learned so far, you can do the following next steps, depending on your preferences:

* Read on to Part 4 to learn about JavaScript gotchas and extras to help you understand the more tricky part of the language
* Take on one of FreeCodeCamp's challenges to further improve your JavaScript mastery
* Create a personal portfolio site using free services like [Codepen](https://codepen.io)
* Create a web application that you're interested in, and share it on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/)
* Learn more about JavaScript's popular framework and libraries, like Angular, React and Express

With the JavaScript skills you have learned, you can choose between coding for the frontend or the backend stack. Frontend involves adding interactivity and fetching data from external source, while backend focuses on data recording and responding to network requests.

## Thank You for reading

Thank You for reading this book. I wish you the best of luck in your career as a software developer/ engineer. If you don't mind, can you give an honest review of the book in the [GitHub repository page](https://github.com/nsebhastian/learn-javascript-with-hedwix) and share this book with friends that might be interested in it? It means a lot to me to see people love the book and use it to improve their skill, even in just a small way.

While I've done the best I can to write this book, I humbly acknowledge that this book is far from perfect. I would love to know your thoughts â€“ what was good, what needs improvement, or any suggestions for specific knowledge and example that might be of help for everyone.

See you again around the Internet!
